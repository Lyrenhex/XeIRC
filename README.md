# XeIRC
### Pronounced "zairc"
Python text-based IRC client with native NickServ support.

XeIRC is an open-source half-text-based half-gui-based IRC client written in Python3.

Making use of Python's multithreading capability, XeIRC has a command-line chat output window, and an easygui "Send message" enterbox.

XeIRC is still in active development and has a lot of capabilities to be added, as all IRC logic is being added in to work with the socket-module backend of XeIRC.

XeIRC also has built-in NickServ password support, however there is currently no support for password-protected servers - these are being worked on.
